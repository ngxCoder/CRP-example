                    "King of Space." "Master of the Sun." You claim such vast domains. Is it to balance your small souls? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Could I not lay claim to the light and the void, if I wished it? Have I not earned such titles?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I, who have mastered all arts, all sciences, all secrets? Whose technology and magic cross the stars as easily as they scramble an alpha telepath's mind?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who would dare to say I have not earned the right? Yet I am king of a simple nation. On a simple planet. A beloved garden tended by iron hands. And the only title I have ever claimed... is doctor.
